// Final Project
//================
// You need to add a new project called VGP242_Final under VGP242
// Create a solar system scene using textured mapped spheres
// - Add this to your MeshBuilder:
//	static MeshPX CreateSpherePX(uint32_t rings, uint32_t slices, float radius);
// - This is basically the same as cylinder but each ring as a different radius
// - The radius should be using sin(*something with y here*)
// - You also need to make sure you have the planets spinning locally and revolving around the sun
// - This is based on your world matrix rotation and translation order
// - Finally add CreateSkybox() which is essentially a cube but with reversed indices order
// - This is so you can texture map the inside of the box, as a skybox, it will have a very large size
